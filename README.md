# Python Core Data Structures Mastery

## Overview
This repository demonstrates comprehensive understanding and practical application of Python's fundamental data structures: **Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Files**. Each module includes implementations that showcase efficient data manipulation, memory optimization, and real-world problem-solving approaches.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. Lists
- Basic operations (append, extend, slice, sort)
- List comprehensions and generator expressions
- Performance considerations and memory usage
- Real applications: Data filtering, sequence processing

### 2. Dictionaries
- Key-value pair manipulations
- Nested dictionaries and complex structures
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Use cases: Configuration management, data mapping

### 3. Tuples & Sets
- Immutability and hashability concepts
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Data unpacking and multiple return values
- Applications: Data integrity, unique collections

### 4. File Handling
- Reading/writing text and binary files
- CSV and JSON processing
- Context managers and proper resource handling
- Practical: Log processing, configuration files

### 5. Integrated Projects
- **Student Grade Manager**: Using dictionaries for student records and lists for grades
- **Inventory System**: File-based persistence with dictionary data structures
- **Data Aggregation Tool**: Combining multiple data sources into structured formats

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master Python's built-in data structures and their appropriate use cases
- Understand time and space complexity of different operations
- Develop clean, efficient code for data manipulation tasks
- Build foundation for advanced data science and machine learning work

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- Standard Library only (no external dependencies)
- VS Code development environment

## Why This Matters
These fundamentals form the bedrock of all advanced Python programming, especially in data science and AI. Efficient data structure usage is critical for:
- Data preprocessing pipelines
- Algorithm optimization
- Memory management in large-scale applications
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
